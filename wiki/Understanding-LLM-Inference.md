# Understanding LLM Inference

This guide explains how Large Language Models (LLMs) work and what you're seeing when you use Inferno to visualize the inference process.

## What is LLM Inference?

LLM inference is the process by which a trained language model generates text. When you give a model a prompt, it uses its learned knowledge to predict what should come next, one piece (token) at a time.

### The Basic Process
1. **Tokenization**: Your input text is broken into tokens
2. **Context Processing**: The model processes all previous tokens
3. **Prediction**: The model predicts probabilities for the next token
4. **Selection**: One token is chosen based on these probabilities
5. **Repeat**: The process continues with the new token added to context

## Tokens: The Building Blocks

### What are Tokens?
Tokens are the basic units that LLMs work with. They can be:
- **Whole words**: "hello", "world", "computer"
- **Parts of words**: "un-", "-ing", "pre-"
- **Punctuation**: ".", "!", "?"
- **Special characters**: spaces, numbers, symbols

### Token Examples
```
Input: "The quick brown fox"
Tokens: ["The", " quick", " brown", " fox"]

Input: "I'm learning AI"
Tokens: ["I", "'m", " learning", " AI"]

Input: "Hello, world!"
Tokens: ["Hello", ",", " world", "!"]
```

### Why Tokens Matter
- Models think in terms of tokens, not characters or words
- Understanding tokenization helps you write better prompts
- Token limits determine how much text a model can process

## The Prediction Process

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

**Step 1: Context Embedding**
- The model converts each token into a numerical representation
- These embeddings capture semantic meaning and relationships

**Step 2: Attention Mechanism**
- The model determines which previous tokens are most relevant
- Attention weights show what the model is "focusing on"

**Step 3: Logit Generation**
- The model outputs raw scores (logits) for every possible next token
- Higher logits indicate higher confidence

**Step 4: Probability Calculation**
- Logits are converted to probabilities using softmax
- Probabilities sum to 1.0 across all possible tokens

**Step 5: Token Selection**
- A token is chosen based on the probability distribution
- Selection method affects randomness and creativity

## What Inferno Shows You

### Token Stream Visualization
When you see tokens appearing in real-time, you're watching:
- **Auto-regressive generation**: Each token depends on all previous tokens
- **Processing speed**: How quickly the model can make predictions
- **Generation flow**: The natural progression of the model's "thinking"

### Logits and Probabilities
The probability bars show:
- **Model confidence**: How certain the model is about its next choice
- **Alternative possibilities**: What other tokens were considered
- **Decision uncertainty**: Whether the choice was clear or difficult

### Real-Time Updates
Each generation step shows:
- **Current context**: All tokens generated so far
- **Prediction confidence**: Probability distribution for next token
- **Selection process**: Which token was actually chosen

## Key Concepts Explained

### Temperature
Temperature controls randomness in token selection:
- **Low temperature (0.1-0.3)**: More predictable, focused output
- **Medium temperature (0.5-0.8)**: Balanced creativity and coherence
- **High temperature (0.9-1.5)**: More random, creative output

```
Temperature 0.1: "The capital of France is Paris."
Temperature 1.0: "The capital of France is Paris, a beautiful city..."
Temperature 1.5: "The capital of France? Well, definitely Paris, though..."
```

### Top-K Sampling
Limits selection to the K most likely tokens:
- **Low K (10-20)**: Conservative, safe choices
- **Medium K (40-50)**: Balanced selection
- **High K (100+)**: More diverse possibilities

### Top-P (Nucleus) Sampling
Selects from tokens that collectively have probability P:
- **Low P (0.1-0.3)**: Very focused selection
- **Medium P (0.5-0.9)**: Balanced approach
- **High P (0.95-1.0)**: Considers many possibilities

## Common Patterns in Inference

### High Confidence Predictions
You'll notice high confidence when:
- Completing common phrases: "The United States of..." → "America"
- Following grammar rules: "She is..." → "a", "the", "an"
- Continuing factual statements: "Water boils at..." → "100°C"

### Low Confidence Predictions
Lower confidence occurs when:
- Multiple valid continuations exist
- The model encounters ambiguous context
- Creative or open-ended generation is required

### Attention Patterns
Though not directly visualized, attention affects:
- Which previous tokens influence the current prediction
- How context window limitations impact generation
- Why models sometimes "forget" earlier context

## Model Behavior Insights

### What Makes Good Generations?
- **Coherence**: Logical flow from token to token
- **Consistency**: Maintaining context and character
- **Relevance**: Staying on topic and answering prompts appropriately

### Common Generation Issues
- **Repetition**: Model gets stuck in loops
- **Incoherence**: Losing track of context or topic
- **Hallucination**: Generating plausible but incorrect information

### Prompt Engineering Implications
Understanding inference helps you:
- Write more effective prompts
- Predict how models will respond
- Debug unexpected outputs
- Optimize for desired behavior

## Advanced Concepts

### Context Window
- Models can only "remember" a limited number of recent tokens
- Older context may be forgotten as new tokens are added
- This affects long conversations and document processing

### Beam Search vs. Sampling
- **Sampling**: Randomly select based on probabilities (what Inferno shows)
- **Beam Search**: Keep track of multiple possible sequences
- **Greedy**: Always pick the highest probability token

### Model Architecture Effects
Different model architectures affect:
- **Speed**: How quickly inference completes
- **Quality**: How coherent and accurate outputs are
- **Specialization**: What tasks the model excels at

## Practical Applications

### Debugging Prompts
Use Inferno to understand:
- Why a model gives unexpected responses
- Where in generation things go wrong
- How different prompts affect model behavior

### Prompt Optimization
Observe how changes affect:
- Confidence levels in predictions
- Diversity of possible continuations
- Overall generation quality

### Model Comparison
Compare different models by watching:
- Speed of inference
- Confidence patterns
- Quality of token-by-token decisions

## Learning Exercises

### Exercise 1: Observe Confidence Patterns
Try these prompts and watch confidence levels:
1. "The capital of France is"
2. "In my opinion, the best movie is"
3. "Once upon a time"

### Exercise 2: Temperature Effects
Use the same prompt with different temperatures:
- Temperature 0.1: Notice predictable outputs
- Temperature 0.7: See balanced creativity
- Temperature 1.2: Observe increased randomness

### Exercise 3: Prompt Engineering
Compare these prompt styles:
- "Write a story" vs. "Write a short story about a robot"
- "What is AI?" vs. "Explain artificial intelligence in simple terms"
